# Spring SAML

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-projects/spring-security-saml.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-saml/)

Spring SAML Extension allows seamless inclusion of SAML 2.0 Service Provider capabilities in Spring applications. All products supporting SAML 2.0 in Identity Provider mode (e.g. ADFS 2.0, Shibboleth, OpenAM/OpenSSO, Ping Federate, Okta) can be used to connect with Spring SAML Extension.

## Current status

This repository is not being actively maintained, but will remain hosted for educational and reference purposes.
It contains an independent, easier to use and abstracted through Java POJOs, SAML library on top of the OpenSAML library. 
The concept was also validated against Keycloak as the underlying dependency.

The effort continues at the code [Spring Security](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.2.0.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#saml2) project.
It's goals are to provide a framework abstraction, as opposed to a library, for SAML 2 Authentication.

We continue to accept pull request for all branches, but will not actively drive feature development
in this repository.

## What it was
This project is being rewritten. There is a base implementation in the 
[develop](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-saml/tree/develop) including 
milestone releases in the [milestone](https://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/security/extensions/spring-security-saml2-core/)
repository.

In the [develop-3.0](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-saml/tree/develop) branch we are creating a 
solution that builds on top of the milestones and is better aligned with Spring Security.
The intent with this branch is to merge it with the [Spring Security](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security) 
project and release as part of Spring Security core.

For that reason, we will not be publishing any official releases of the 2.0.0 milestones, but will maintain it
until all feature functionality that exists in the milestones are part of Spring Security.

## Getting Started

We have provided [samples](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-saml/tree/develop/samples/boot) to get started with. These samples are meant to be very [simple](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-saml/tree/develop/samples/boot).
